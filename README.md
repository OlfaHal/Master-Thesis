# Master-Thesis
# Project Description

This project combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore advanced machine learning techniques for analyzing and processing structured and unstructured data. The primary focus is to leverage the complementary strengths of GNNs and LLMs to enhance predictions, extract insights, or solve complex tasks involving graph-structured and textual data.

Features and Objectives

Integration of GNNs and LLMs: Develop a unified approach to harness the power of both models.

Flexible Framework: Adaptable to various datasets and applications.

Graph Analysis: Leverage GNNs for structured data insights.

Text Processing: Utilize LLMs for advanced natural language understanding.

End-to-End Pipeline: Comprehensive processing from data loading to model evaluation.
