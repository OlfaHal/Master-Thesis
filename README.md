# Master Thesis: GNN + LLM Integration

## Project Description
This project combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore advanced machine learning techniques for analyzing and processing structured and unstructured data.

---

## Features and Objectives
- **Integration of GNNs and LLMs**: Develop a unified approach to harness the power of both models.
- **Flexible Framework**: Adaptable to various datasets and applications.
- **Graph Analysis**: Leverage GNNs for structured data insights.
- **Text Processing**: Utilize LLMs for advanced natural language understanding.
- **End-to-End Pipeline**: Comprehensive processing from data loading to model evaluation.
